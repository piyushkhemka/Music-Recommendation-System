Designed & developed a Collaborative Filtering & Content Based Recommendation system to generate music

Collaborative Filtering was implemented in Apache Spark, while Content Based Recommendation was implemented in Python.


*** University policy prohibits me from sharing the code online.
However, the report (outlining the design & methodology) is linked
and code is available on request.
